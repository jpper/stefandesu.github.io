Hello awesome people!

This week's post is going to be short. I hasn't been my best week and I fell short on a lot of things, so there's not much to say. Sorry for that! Next week is certainly going to be better. ☺️

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion...&quot; <a href="https://t.co/InZ58zkoAm">pic.twitter.com/InZ58zkoAm</a></p>&mdash; Barack Obama (@BarackObama) <a href="https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/896523232098078720">August 13, 2017</a></blockquote>This became the new most liked tweet on Twitter, for a good reason I think.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Need more Game of Thrones!!!!!</p>&mdash; Stefan Peters (@stefandesu) <a href="https://twitter.com/stefandesu/status/897195538277437441">August 14, 2017</a></blockquote>Always need more Game of Thrones. At least I'll see the new episode tomorrow! 🎉 Oh and it's the second to last episode of this season, so there might be some good action coming up!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When I came back to Germany, I changed my phone’s language to Japanese and could only read some of it. Now I can read almost everything! 🎉💪🏼</p>&mdash; Stefan Peters (@stefandesu) <a href="https://twitter.com/stefandesu/status/898834314045075456">August 19, 2017</a></blockquote>頑張るよ！

Maybe I’ll post a little demonstration later.</p>&mdash; Stefan Peters (@stefandesu) <a href="https://twitter.com/stefandesu/status/898877693193793536">August 19, 2017</a></blockquote>

## Today: Some Articles!

[Sweet dreams: why do big brands crave climbers?](https://www.thebmc.co.uk/sweet-dreams-why-do-big-brands-crave-climbers)
Very interesting article about companies like Coca Cola and Red Bull sponsoring climbers.

[The long-overdue movement to abandon Caps Lock.](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2010/12/good_riddance.html)
I didn't know that Caps Lock originated from typewriters. Personally, I haven't used Caps Lock on my computer in years. On Mac it's super easy to just turn it off. I went a bit further and turned it into a [hyper key](http://brettterpstra.com/2017/06/15/a-hyper-key-with-karabiner-elements-full-instructions/) (cmd + alt + ctrl + shift), which I basically use as an additional control key for easier keyboard shortcuts. Very handy.

[Why you should never, ever use two spaces after a period.](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2011/01/space_invaders.html)
I found this article after correcting tons of double spaces in a document for my work. These weren't double spaces after a period, but it still made me google it. This also originated from typewriters and from using monospaced fonts (like this blog actually).

## See You Next Week!
✌🏻
