Hello there!

I made it! There was a lot going on this week, and I'm so relieved I made it through. 

On Wednesday afternoon, I had another exam, and as always I started studying way too late. I ended up doing most of the studying on Tuesday evening and Wednesday. This definitely wasn't enough time neither to study all that I needed, nor to actually internalize and understand the material. On several occasions during the exam I had the problem that I just couldn't remember the connection, I wasn't able to connect the name of what they wanted explained to the things that I studied. Well, I made it anyway, and got a decent grade as well. I definitely can't complain. 🙂

A day later I had a phone call with a guy who contacted me on Xing (actually the call was with his colleage). I was a bit nervous about this, but it ended up being a super chilled call and he was a really cool guy! (If there's anything coming out of this, I'll let you know here.)

Then on the weekend, I had to catch up on all the work stuff that I've been neglecting due to the other things on my mind. So I worked a lot today and yesterday and finished the important task this afternoon! 👍 There are still a few more tasks left, but those are not as time sensitive as today's was.

This evening, my flatmate and I got ourselves some pizza and watched the...

## Netflix Death Note Movie
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s even worse than I expected. And I had VERY low expectations.</p>&mdash; Stefan Peters (@stefandesu) <a href="https://twitter.com/stefandesu/status/901891501113954304">August 27, 2017</a></blockquote> I guess I'll leave it at that. (My friend and I will make a podcast about this, but it'll be in German.)

## Kanji
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If the Anki statistics are correct, I reached half of the jouyou kanji today. 😵🎉 Another 1068 to go… 💪🏼</p>&mdash; Stefan Peters (@stefandesu) <a href="https://twitter.com/stefandesu/status/899748853674586112">August 21, 2017</a></blockquote>This is a really big achievement for me! There are 2136 so called 常用漢字 (jouyou kanji = "general use kanji") and I now know a little more than half of these. I think studying kanji is a lot of fun and I guess I still have quite a lot ahead of me. 😅

## Other Stuff
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gotta go back to running again. Maybe my ankle issues are gone by now.</p>&mdash; Stefan Peters (@stefandesu) <a href="https://twitter.com/stefandesu/status/900794164459094016">August 24, 2017</a></blockquote>They're not... 😕

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">&quot;Solar Eclipse&quot; in Japanese is literally &quot;sun eating.&quot;<br><br>日食 → Read as にっしょく / nisshoku<br><br>日 = sun<br>食 = eat, meal <a href="https://t.co/oTpAggVRjK">pic.twitter.com/oTpAggVRjK</a></p>&mdash; トーフグ (@tofugu) <a href="https://twitter.com/tofugu/status/899691162105245696">August 21, 2017</a></blockquote>Japanese never disappoints.

Only in Japan. Naturally this made me think of a "gaijin rental" and of course I'm not the first one with the idea. But the guys that did this in 2013/2014 seem to have gone completely inactive. A good business opportunity I guess. 😂

Really good and interesting video about black holes! It's a lot of speculation, but black holes are just so mind blowing.

[Starting, Over and Over Again](https://zenhabits.net/startmeup/) on Zen Habits
A good article explaining that the most important thing is to start, especially in those times when you need to pick up a habit that's been neglected recently (because of travel, work, ...).

## See You Next Week!
Hopefully, I'll finally have published a new video by then! ✌🏻
