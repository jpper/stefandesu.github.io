As an effort to procrastinate on studying for the upcoming exam, I now introduce a comment secion under my blog posts! It's still under construction, you'll see that it currently doesn't integrate with my theme very well. But it seems to be working!

I just hope I won't get spammed to death. I'm not sure if there are some anti spam modules for this.

By the way, I'm using a self-hosted comment system named [Isso](https://posativ.org/isso/) (yes, like the Pokemon). It would have been easier to use something like Disqus, but I really don't like to include external libraries and scripts into my blog. So I installed Isso onto my Uberspace (which powers this blog as well) and all is good.

So if you have anything to say about this, please leave a comment below! üòÅ

Update: I tinkered a bit with the CSS and it looks much better now! You might have to empty your browser cache to make it look right though.
