Hi there!

With this post, I want to give you an update about recent life in Tokyo. Yesterday, I bumped into a friend I met at Yahoo's Lodge and he updated me about his Vipassana retreat. I'm working on wrapping things up at my current job at Fuji TV Lab, and trying to get my <a href="https://japaninfojobs.netlify.com" target="_blank">application</a> somewhat ready to be used. I'll be starting my first full-time, 正社員 job in Japan at a video game company called Mighty Craft starting next week, so I'm at once excited and rather nervous for that!

I was able to attend my church's first "Heart For Giving Morning" event yesterday morning, where they briefed us on the giving over this year and what the breakdown of the church's finances is. You can check out their website <a href="https://mylifehouse.com" target="_blank">here</a>.

That's it! If you actually went through the whole post, thank you very much, and please let me know what you think about this. My preferred means of communication at the moment is actually Twitter (might be obvious after embedding so many tweets...): <a href="https://twitter.com/stefandesu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@stefandesu</a>

Bye!
