Hey everyone,

I just wanted to write a short post because it's better than doing nothing on here. In the last about 1 1/2 weeks I've been lacking the energy to do much. Last week has been the worst week in terms of productivity this year for me and it doesn't feel like this week is going to be much better. I'm not sure what the cause might be though. It might be mental (I've been thinking about my future a lot lately and haven't made much progress so far) or physical (maybe a sickness that won't come fully through, or some kind of vitamin deficiency which isn't that unlikely). I'm definitely trying to find out and fix it, and I'm still making sure to do all the important things (tasks for my job, Anki, etc.). I really hope that it'll get better very soon!
