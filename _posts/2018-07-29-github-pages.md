Hello there!

It's been a while, I know. Much happened in these last few months, and I'm going to come back to that in a later post. With this post, I just wanted to let you know that I'm still here and that I still plan to post again! I often have thoughts that might do well as a blog post, but for some reason I never commit to actually writing a post. In general, I haven't been writing a lot recently, to be honest. Even my diary hasn't seen an entry in quite a while. I think the only thing I've been writing is technical documentation for work. That kind of counts, but not really.

Talking about technical things, I've finally moved this blog over to GitHub Pages! I've been wanting to do this for a while, but the big problem was that I couldn't use my theme with Jekyll (which is what GitHub Pages is using). Yesterday, I finally created a whole new blog theme for Jekyll, obviously based on my previous theme. The colors and layout are the same, but there are some little changes that just seemed better that way. It's not completely finished yet, but I'm already super happy with it, especially since I made it from the ground up. Obviously, both the blog and the theme are on GitHub: [theme](https://github.com/stefandesu/exo-blog-theme), [blog](https://github.com/stefandesu/stefandesu.github.io). Those repos still need some tidying up though. ;) Especially the theme is very much tailored to my own needs and not really suitable for general use yet.

Anyway, that's it for now! I'm going to write a new update post next week to get you back on track about what has happened in my life recently. See you!
