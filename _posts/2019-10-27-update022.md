I know there are some of you who don't use Instagram, and as Instagram is currently the main way for me to share what's going on, I will give you regular updates on my Instagram posts here. I'm also uploading my Instagram Stories (the highlights at least) on YouTube and share the links here as well.

## Posts
I've only made one actual post so far (in fact, I just published it now 🙈), so here you go: <https://www.instagram.com/p/B4G5BZNpOxn/>

## Stories
Disclaimer: If you don't know what Instagram Stories are, they are a way to share short random snippets (pictures or videos) of your day with your followers, and these things will disappear after 24 hours (the owner can still access them and put them into highlights to be viewed later). If you've never watched Instagram Stories, watching these might feel weird at times, especially because it switches between clips with and without sound. Also, if you view Stories inside the app, you can easily skip to the next clip which you can't do when watching them on YouTube. Just so you know. ;)

Also, if you don't want to watch all of these, you can skip the first few. I can recommend (04) and (05) though!

**(台風) 🇯🇵 2019/20**

How the recent taifun was for me (not much happened in Tokyo to be honest).

Roppongi, Asakusa by night, random activities.

**(05) 🇯🇵 2019/20**

Being nostalgic about Kandai-mae (Osaka, where I did my student exchange three years ago), playing Settlers of Catan and Jenga with old friends (so much fun!).

Next time there won't be so many at once. 😉 Let me know what you liked and what you didn't like about these! It's always easier to do when you have friends around, that's why the last two are (in my opinion) better than the rest. ☺️
